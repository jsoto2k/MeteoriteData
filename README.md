# MeteoriteData
In this project, I created a jupyter notebook which makes use of one hot encoding and data cleanup in order to predict the year that a meteorite fell by modeling it through the XGBoost and Bayesian Ridge Model
I encoded the classification type, and then removed the following columns: name, id, nametype, geolocation, and fall.

The Bayesian Ridge Model had roughly 50% accuracy while the XGBoost model had about 70% accuracy
